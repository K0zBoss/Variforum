# Ozmo — Interaction Layer (MVP Pending)

Ozmo is an interface layer within the Variforum system.

It is a calm, single-scene interactive environment designed to explore how presence, return, and attention can be acknowledged without pressure, metrics, or extraction.

Ozmo is intentionally minimal and emotionally oriented.

---

## Purpose

Ozmo exists to:

- Provide a human-facing entry point into Variforum’s design philosophy
- Test non-coercive interaction patterns
- Explore growth without visible metrics
- Serve as a grounding artifact for future system layers

Ozmo is not intended to be addictive, competitive, or optimized for retention.

---

## Core Constraints

- No scores, timers, or visible progression
- No notifications, streaks, or penalties
- No dialogue systems or instructions
- Visual change is the only form of feedback
- Absence is neutral

These constraints are foundational, not features.

---

## Status

- MVP scope defined
- Implementation intentionally deferred
- Will be built as a single-scene prototype

---

Ozmo is a component, not a product.
