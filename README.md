# Variforum — Foundational Repository (Pre-Implementation)

This repository establishes public technical and conceptual provenance for **Variforum**, a human-centered information and interaction system designed to restore trust, authorship, and agency in digital environments.

Variforum is not a platform, product, or application in the conventional sense.
It is a layered architecture for verified human contribution, intentional interaction, and non-extractive design.

This repository is intentionally minimal at this stage.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repo exists to:

- Establish **public authorship and timestamped provenance**
- Anchor future implementation to a known, documented origin
- Define non-negotiable constraints before code exists
- Prevent premature or misaligned execution

Executable code will be introduced only after architectural alignment and collaboration are established.

---

## System Overview (High-Level)

Variforum is composed of distinct layers, each with strict boundaries:

- **Foundational principles** — non-negotiable constraints and intent
- **Interaction layers** — human-facing environments that embody those principles
- **Verification and governance systems** — defined separately and intentionally

Individual components may be built, tested, or released independently, but all derive from the same foundational constraints.

---

## Repository Structure

/variforum
/ozmo — Interactive interface layer (cozy, non-extractive)
/docs — Public-facing philosophy and system intent

Additional layers will be added deliberately as implementation begins.

---

## Design Constraints (Canonical)

The following constraints apply across the Variforum system unless explicitly overridden:

- Human attention is not a commodity
- Participation must never be coerced
- Absence must not be punished
- Authority must be earned, contextual, and revisable
- Systems must be legible to the people inside them

Any implementation that violates these constraints is incorrect by definition.

---

## Current Status

- ✅ Conceptual architecture established
- ✅ Public provenance recorded
- ⏳ Technical implementation pending
- ⏳ Selective collaboration in exploration

This repository will remain documentation-first until execution begins.

---

## Collaboration

Variforum is currently in **selective collaboration mode**.

I am interested in working with a small number of technically aligned collaborators who:
- Respect constraint-driven system design
- Are comfortable building deliberately and transparently
- Prefer durable systems over short-term optimization

Details will be shared once implementation begins.

## Legal & Authorship

All original concepts, documentation, and future implementations are authored by the project originator unless otherwise noted.

This repository serves as a public timestamp and authorship record.
